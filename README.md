# API-ANALYSIS
As a Data Analyst i will be optaining the weather of many citites using a Weather Map API. With the generated info i'll create scatter plots comparing Latitude vs Temperature, Humdity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed for the cities. Dividing cities by Northern and Southern Hemisphere i'll compute linear regression scatter plots to visualize future predictions for each. Next i will be using the VacationsPy.ipynb to display maps humidity in different citites. Using 10,000 meters of my coordinates i will use the api to search for nearest hotels showing my work in a map. The map will consist of Longitude, Latitude, City, Humidity, Hotel Name, Country when hovering over each dot on the map. With this information i will obtain the best vacation spot and nearby hotel across the globe.
